# Climate & Energy Analytics

## Overview
This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions data to study long-term emission trends, per-capita impact, and the relationship between CO₂ emissions and GDP. The objective was to extract meaningful environmental and economic insights using structured data analysis.

## Problem Statement
How have emissions evolved over time, and how do economic growth and carbon emissions correlate across major economies?

## Dataset
- CO₂ emissions dataset (Our World in Data)
- GDP datasets
- Country-level comparison data

## Approach

1. Data Cleaning  
   - Cleaned and structured raw datasets using Python (Pandas)  
   - Standardized country names and handled missing values  

2. SQL Analysis  
   - Wrote queries to extract country-specific trends  
   - Compared India, China, and the United States  

3. Time-Series Analysis  
   - Analyzed emissions trends across decades  
   - Compared per-capita vs total emissions  

4. Visualization  
   - Built trend plots and correlation visualizations using Matplotlib  

## Key Insights
- Rapid emission growth in emerging economies.
- Strong correlation between GDP growth and CO₂ emissions in developing nations.
- Per-capita emissions reveal different sustainability patterns compared to total emissions.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SQL
- Google BigQuery

## Future Improvements
- Add renewable energy trend analysis
- Build interactive dashboard version
